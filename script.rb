#Ruby code to come.
#So I want to input my bike rides and see what I could eat for the calories.
#Ideally I'd like to use the Strava API but let's not get ahead of ourselves.
#Start with a function that will take one argument - the calories burnt by one bike ride.
#Actually, will it need two arguments? One hash with the items I could eat and one integer for the calories burned.
